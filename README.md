## True random number

Some facts of PRNG(Pseudo Random Number Generator)

- Python's `random()` function use the current system time as the default init seed.
- In Python, we can use `random.seed()` to initialize the generator. Then, the random number series generated by `random.random()` is determined by the seed.
- In Go, we can use `rand.Rand.Seed(seed int64)` to initialize the generator.

### ways to get the seed

1. Use the fingerprint of the runtime machine as a part of the seed, such as MAC address. It could be replayable on the specific machine.
2. Collect randomness from the nature, such as fingerprint, the movement of the mouse on the screen. It's not convenient for automation.
3. Use one or more internal steps to make the progresss more compex, such as Sha256 or provide a random number as the seed of new random generator. It's insecure to prevent from being cracked by the person who develop the system.

So, the full automation and true randomness from nature is contradictory. There must be at least one true randomness in the system, and the other randomness could be generated from the root randomness with simple or complex steps.

So we can choose a root true randomness in our favorite ways.

I got a true randomness `0a1b2f65373c93ea74ff8c0e84b3068feaad149b44efbdcb98061ffefa5dfb83` from the [Drand](https://drand.love/) and drop it's corresponding round number. Alrough attacker could loop on the round numbers and try for each to get the root randomness. The less people known about this root randomness, the secure it will be as well.

Combined with the approach 3, the system security is leveled up.

#### Update

[fortuna](https://github.com/seehuhn/fortuna) implemented the Fortuna algorithm. It accept updates of randomness from the environment.
